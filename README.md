## Usage

OverloadFn is very simple to use: just `import` the the `@Overload()` decorator and use it on your first function definition, the use `@<function_name>.overload()` thereafter.

You can either specify the argument types in the decorator itself, like this

``` python
from numbers import Real
from overloadfn import Overload

@Overload(Real)
def area(radius):
    import math
    return math.pi * radius*radius

@area.overload(Real, Real)
def area(len, breath):
    calc = len * breath
    return calc

class Animal(object):
    def sound(self):
        return 'moo!'

class Dog(Animal):
    @Overload()
    def sound(self):
        return 'bark!'
    
    @sound.overload(Real)
    def sound(self, i):
        return 'woof, {} math!'.format(i)
  
print(area(1))    # 3.141519
print(area(2,3))  # 6
d = Dog()
print(d.sound())  # bark!
print(d.sound(1)) # woof, 1 math!

```

Notice both top-level functions and class methods are supported.

**Or** you may use type-hints (make sure to still include the brackets after the decorator though!), like this

``` python
from typing import Union, List, Dict
from numbers import Real
from overloadfn import Overload

@Overload()
def area(radius:Real) -> Real:
    import math
    return math.pi * radius*radius

@area.overload()
def area(len:Real, breath:Real) -> Real:
    calc = len * breath
    return calc

@area.overload()
def area(arg:Union[List,Dict]) -> str:
    return 'You\'ve passed a List or a Dict argument'

print(area(1))   # 3.141519
print(area(2,3)) # 6
print(area([]))  # 'You\'ve passed a List or a Dict argument'
```

Yes you can even use `Union`! Providing no explicit type for an argument in the `@Overload()` or `@<function_name>.overload()` decorators (as well as no type-hints) will behave the same as passing in `typing.Any` for that argument. 

## Tests

There are some basic unit tests included in the package, you can run these from the root of the package (the same directory as `setup.py`) by running
``` bash
python3 -m pip --install nose
nosetests --verbose
```

## Warnings / To Do

Do note
* The overloading is based on the position **and** type of the arguments, therefore you should not use keyword arguments when calling overloaded function (the behaviour will not be well defined).

I welcome any feedback or pull requests.
